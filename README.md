# M1_SCIENTIFIC-CALCULATOR
mini project- SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR
          Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic four operations in mathematics ,they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this Project which I'm Implementing ,also included five additional operations such as Factorial, Power ,modulas, square, cube .However, the input has to be in the form "number1 operator1 number2 "(i.e 2+4).

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas/square/cube, in another word it is implemented with the order of precedence logic.
